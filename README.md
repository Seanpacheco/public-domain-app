## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDb

I used NodeJS and Express to pull results from a MongoDb database depending on the search parameters input by the user. The User has to option so search by genre and # of roles in a form on the frontend or searching directly by name which useses client side Javascript and Jquery to autocomplete the search box with titles from the MongoDb database. Users will then be displayed a result page with all results that match the parameters where they can choose to view more information about each play and add plays to their favorites. Users can then add plays to their favorites and on their dashboard they can assign people to roles in each play.

## Optimizations

Add REACT to frontend


## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to connect and interact with a MongoDb database on the backend. Also how to pass parameters from the client side to the server side. It was a blast to continue improving my backend skills and working within a MVC architecture.
