# PlayRight
Search a MongoDb database for Public Domain plays that match specific parameters or search by name of play.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDb

I used NodeJS and Express to pull results from a MongoDb database depending on the search parameters input by the user. The User has to option so search by genre and # of roles in a form on the frontend or searching directly by name which useses client side Javascript to autocomplete the search box with titles from the MongoDb database. Users will then be displayed a result page with all results that match the parameters where they can choose to view more information about each play and add plays to their favorites.

## Optimizations

Add REACT to frontend


## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to connect and interact with a MongoDb database on the backend. Also how to pass parameters from the client side to the server side. It was a blast to continue improving my backend skill and working within a MVC architecture.
